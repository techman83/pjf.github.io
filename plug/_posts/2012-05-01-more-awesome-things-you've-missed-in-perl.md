Awesome things have been happening in Perl recently; so many that even if you’ve been paying close attention, you may have missed a few. In this talk we’ll examine some of the coolest recent technologies for Perl programmers, including:

* Overhauling Perl’s Object Oriented framework with Moose.
* Making everything a first-class object with autobox.
* Slashing your error handling code with autodie.
* Building fast, readable and reusable regular expressions with Perl 5.10.
* Bundling and building stand-alone applications using PAR, the Perl Archiver.
* Astonishingly good profiling with Devel::NYTProf.
* Playing MineSweeper automatically with App::SweeperBot.
