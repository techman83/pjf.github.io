At the [Linux Conf Au](https://lca2018.org/) [Games and Foss](https://lca2018.org/programme/miniconfs/games/) Mini Conference, @ducky_tape and @The_McJones gave me an opportunity to talk on my experiences archiving over 11,000 mods for Kerbal Space Program. It was also captured by the awesome LCA AV Team, which you can watch here!

A special shout out to @ducky_tape, who created her first ever PCB as a thank you gift!

She also did a lightning talk on the process, which was super interesting!
