iVEC has a team entering the Student Cluster Competition at SC13 in the US later this year. This is the pre-eminent event in the High Performance Computing (HPC) world and it's great for Australia, and in particular Western Australia to be involved thanks to iVEC and their sponsors.

The team gave a presentation at PLUG going through the ins and outs of super computing, the state of super compuing in WA, and information about the competition itself. 

This was a really great talk and thanks to iVEC and the team for presenting!
