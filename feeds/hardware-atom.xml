One of the things I really wanted to do was utilise some form of machine learning to make decisions about when I wanted the Shed's Airconditioning or the wall fan turned on. I could have utilised rules in my &lt;a href="http://www.openhab.org/"&gt;OpenHAB&lt;/a&gt; based home automation system, however I'd already gotten reasonably creative with those and wanted a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been learning about machine learning for a while, in particular however it was this post on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30991592/support-vector-machine-in-python-using-libsvm-example-of-features"&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; and sentdex's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v"&gt;Machine Learning with Python&lt;/a&gt; playlist that really helped me find a solution that appeared to fit what I was trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a couple of &lt;a href="http://www.freetronics.com.au/products/humidity-and-temperature-sensor-module"&gt;DHT22&lt;/a&gt; sensor modules attached to &lt;a href="https://www.wemos.cc/product/d1-mini.html"&gt;Wemos D1 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, I was readily collecting Temporature data into OpenHAB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled on a Support Vector Machine algorithm as it seemed to best fit my dataset of "inTemperatur,inHumidity,outTemperature,outHumidity" and my decisions required being On or Off. The following video does an excellent job of explaining SVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up writing a Python script that listens for change and learn events on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT"&gt;MQTT&lt;/a&gt; message bus which ties my home automation system together. OpenHAB fires change events when I'm present in the shed and fires learn events when I manually turn on AC or Fan on. If 'themachine' predicts a positive result greater than 95% certaintity it will fire back to a channel that OpenHAB has a switch sitting on to receive the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example log of an event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can find out more information about how to implement something similar on &lt;a href="https://github.com/techman83/habsvm-themachine"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, it's MIT licensed so feel free to use the code how you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, the first time it came on by itself was a little weird. I was standing on a stepladder doing some terminating in my rack (yes of course I have a full height network rack in my shed), thinking that it had gotten a little warm &lt;em&gt;AC Turns on&lt;/em&gt; ... "woah". Skynet however is a long way off, well at least in my little home automation setup.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="homeautomation"></category><category term="machinelearning"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="python"></category></entry></feed>
