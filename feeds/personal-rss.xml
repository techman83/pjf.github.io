I figured the best place to start was replacing my Clutch Master Cylinder, after 18 years of service it was no longer operating very well.

Being a Shimano HollowTech II, the different screw in type BBs are interchangeable. So long as you get the correct thread and width. Mine had the english thread (1.37x24) and the bracket width of 68mm.

&lt;p&gt;For those that don't know me, I like to cycle. Though I do find it difficult to fit the time in, I find it really easy to make it part of my commute to work.
